The dataset is explored and preprocessed to uncover trends in demographics, socioeconomic factors, and generational influences on suicide rates. Multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression) are trained to predict suicide rates, with an emphasis on feature engineering and model evaluation.

Features:
- Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations of trends and patterns.
- Machine learning models for suicide rate prediction.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
